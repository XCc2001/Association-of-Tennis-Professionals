Graphical representations on the "ATP Men's Tour

## Project Summary for Tennis:

The project delved into the intricate world of men's professional tennis, focusing on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Men's Tour. It employed a robust dataset dating back to January 2000, encompassing data from prestigious competitions, including Grand Slams, Masters Series, Masters Cup, and International Series, among others. The dataset was rich and comprehensive, providing details about various aspects of each match, such as location, tournament name, date, court type, surface, round, and the maximum number of playable sets, among others.

Additionally, the dataset shed light on the profiles of match winners and losers, including their ATP Entry rankings and points at the start of the tournament. Detailed statistics were provided regarding the number of games won by each player in every set, offering an in-depth perspective of each match.

## The Goal
In this project, I utilized Tableau to transform raw data into engaging and comprehensive visualizations. By analyzing and visualizing data from the ATP Men's Tour, I uncovered valuable patterns and trends, providing insights for both enthusiasts and professionals. The use of Tableau as a data visualization tool allowed me to present complex information in an accessible format, creating an interactive journey through the world of professional men's tennis.

This project use data from  http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/data.php to visualize the result of tennis tournament.
